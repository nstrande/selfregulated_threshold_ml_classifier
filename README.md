# Overview
This Python-based Machine Learning (ML) classifier is designed to predict whether an individual has been successfully treated for breast cancer or not. Leveraging a self-regulating mechanism, the classifier optimizes its precision over time to ensure accurate predictions.

# Features
* Utilizes advanced ML techniques to predict breast cancer remission.
* Incorporates a self-regulating mechanism to continuously enhance prediction accuracy.
* Automatically adjusts internal parameters based on real-world outcomes.
* Monitors and adapts to changes in input data distribution.
* Provides reliable predictions for medical decision-making.

# Usage

Create and activate a virtual Python environment and run the following to setup up the project

```bash
make install_dev
```

You can find more details in the Makefile located in the project directory.
